# Shared Plugin for DarkBot

This plugin has been created to make it easier for any developer who wants to implement their features and use them in [Darkbot](https://github.com/darkbot-reloaded/DarkBot).

This repository will always be open source and unlicensed.

We will seek to implement CI/CD in the repository so that developers have a good user experience and many of the tasks are automated.
